1. Truss Analysis by Method of joints

- If a truss is in equilibrium, then each of its joints must also be in equilibrium.
- The method of joints consists of satisfying the equilibrium conditions for the forces exerted on the pin at each joint of the truss.
- Truss members are all straight two-force members lying in the same plane.
- The force system acting at each pin is coplanar and concurrent (intersecting)
- Rotational or moment equilibrium is automatically satisfied at the joint, only need to satisfy ? Fx = 0, ? Fy = 0
- Draw the free-body diagram of a joint having at least one known force and at most two unknown forces (may need to first determine external reactions at the truss supports)
- Establish the sense of the unknown forces
- Always assume the unknown member forces acting on the joints free-body diagram to be in tension (pulling on the pin)
- Assume what is believed to be the correct sense of an unknown member force
- In both cases a negative value indicates that the sense chosen must be reversed
- Orient the x and y axes such that the forces can be easily resolved into their x and y components
- Apply ? Fx = 0 and ? Fy = 0 and solve for the unknown member forces and verify their correct sense
